# changelog-automatic-generation

Test project to verify the functioning of [git cliff](https://git-cliff.org/).

The goal is to use git cliff to automatically generate a `changelog.md` using the git history. 
Only commit messages formatted according to the rules defined by [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) will be considered.

The produced `changelog.md` will respect the format defined via [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
